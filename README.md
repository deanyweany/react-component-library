# React Component Library

Hey guys, my name is Dean and i'm a full-stack developer.

Welcome to my component library. Please check out the code and let me know if there are any issues.

This project skeleton was created to help people get started with creating their own React component library using:
- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

It also features:
- :white_check_mark: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to help you create and show off your components
- :white_check_mark: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) enabling testing of the components

[**Read my blog post about why and how I created this project skeleton â–¸**](https://blog.harveydelaney.com/creating-your-own-react-component-library/)

## Development
### Testing
```shell
npm run test
```

### Building
```shell
npm run build
```

### Storybook
```shell
npm run storybook
```

### Installing component library locally
Let's say you have another project (`test-app`) on your machine that you want to try installing the component library into without having to first publish the component library. In the `test-app` directory, you can run:
```shell
npm i --save ../react-component-library
```
which will install the local component library as a dependency in `test-app`. Your components can then be imported and used.

### Publishing
First make sure that you've updated the `name` field in `package.json` to reflect your NPM package name in your private or public NPM registry. Then run:

```shell
npm publish
```

## Component Usage
Let's say you created a public NPM package called `harvey-component-library` with the `TestComponent` component created in this repository.

Usage of the component (after the library installed as a dependency into another project) will be:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { TestComponent } from "harvey-component-library";

const App = () => (
    <div className="app-container">
        <h1>Hello I'm consuming the component library</h1>
        <TestComponent theme="primary" />
    </div>
);

export default App;
```
